# Decision-Making-in-E-Learning
The idea is to provide a learner the materials that will be nearly perfect fit for his/her style and will help him/her learn in a better and optimized manner. We estimate the learning style, personality and the knowledge level of a learner in order to determine and provide the user with the next topics he/she should learn. To deal with these parameters, membership and non-membership values are determined for every learner. Surveys have been done to collect data based on individual's learning style, personality and knowledge level, which have been cleaned and analyzed to apply algorithms. FSLSM model and OCEAN model is used to determine the membership and non membership values. Intuitionistic genetic algorithm is applied to aggregate and optimize the membership and non membership values, and classified using the knn cassifier which would divide the learners into three different stages.
